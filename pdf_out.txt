FinTrack  —  Test  Case  Specification   |   BugVault  SQA  Hackathon 
How  to  Read  This  Document  
This  document  contains  Gherkin-style  (Given-When-Then)  test  cases  for  every  functional  area  of  
FinTrack,
 
the
 
target
 
banking
 
application
 
used
 
in
 
the
 
BugVault
 
SQA
 
Hackathon.
 
It
 
serves
 
two
 
purposes:
 •  Development  Guide:  Developers  can  use  each  test  case  to  understand  exactly  what  behavior  to  
implement
 
in
 
the
 
application.
 •  AI  Prompt  Reference:  Each  test  case  block  can  be  fed  directly  to  an  AI  code  generator  (e.g.,  
Claude
 
Code)
 
as
 
precise,
 
structured
 
behavior
 
specifications.
  
Legend  
@functional Standard  functional  behavior  test  —  implement  exactly  as  described. @ui UI/UX  behavior  test  —  governs  visual,  layout,  or  interaction  behavior. @boundary Boundary/edge  case  —  test  the  limits  of  valid  input  ranges. @negative Negative  test  —  system  must  reject  or  handle  invalid  input  gracefully. @bug_t1 TIER  1  BUG  FLAG  —  developer  must  intentionally  break  this  behavior  (10  pts  bug). @bug_t2 TIER  2  BUG  FLAG  —  developer  must  intentionally  break  this  behavior  in  a  hidden  way  (50  pts  bug).  Bug-flagged  test  cases  have  their  Gherkin  block  highlighted  in  red.  The  'INTENTIONAL  BUG  FLAG'  
banner
 
below
 
the
 
test
 
case
 
tells
 
the
 
developer
 
exactly
 
what
 
incorrect
 
behavior
 
to
 
code
 
in
 
place
 
of
 
the
 
correct
 
behavior
 
described
 
in
 
the
 
'Then'
 
steps.
 Non-flagged  test  cases  must  be  implemented  correctly  —  they  represent  the  application's  legitimate,  
expected
 
behavior.

❌   FAIL  Condition [ACTUAL  —  BUG]  UI  shows  BDT  10,500.00  (phantom  +500  loyalty  bonus  added  to  display  only).  Ledger  still  holds  BDT  10,000.00  —  permanent  mismatch.  🐛   [INTENTIONAL  BUG  FLAG]   T2-004   |   TIER  2  —  HIDDEN  BUG  (50  pts) Plant  bug:  HIDDEN  BUG:  Add  a  conditional  in  the  balance  display  logic  —  if  (balance  ===  10000)  displayBalance  =  balance  +  500.  This  only  affects  the  UI  render.  The  actual  stored/ledger  balance  remains  10,000.  The  bug  must  look  like  a  visual  display  anomaly,  not  an  obvious  bonus  message.
